This course will not only teach you everything tested on the exam — it will also ground you in cloud engineering concepts. So what is SysOps? Well, it's like a traditional SysAdmin (System Administrator) role that pretty much every company has — but for cloud servers. This freeCodeCamp course will cover Networking, Logging, Metrics, Events, Security, Load Balancing, Serverless Architecture, and more. If you want to take the plunge and learn all these skills, this course has got you covered.

linkTwoText: 'freeCodeCamp just published a TypeScript for beginners course to help you learn the art of statically-typed JavaScript. Most scripting languages like JavaScript and Python are dynamically-typed. But this causes so many additional coding errors. By sticking with static types — like Java and C++ do — JavaScript developers can save themselves a lot of debugging. Instructor and software engineer Bob Ziroll will teach you TypeScript fundamentals like Literal Types, Unions, Generics, and more.

That's an excerpt from my conversation with Scott Hanselman, a software engineer at Microsoft. He shares many of the lessons he's learned from his multi-decade career, and from conducting more than 900 podcast interviews with devs. I talk with him about so many topics, like how it took him 11 years to finish college, and what it's like to lead a fully remote team of devs from his hometown of Portland.

linkFourText: 'Optimistic UI is a new User Interface Design approach that gets its name from its blind optimism. Instead of waiting for confirmation from the server, an Optimistic UI front-end assumes everything will turn out OK, and immediately updates itself to reflect user input. This reduces perceived latency and simplifies complex UI interactions like dragging and dropping. This tutorial by developer Jaja David will teach you key concepts like Stale-While-Revalidate and Optimistic CRUD. It will also explore the drawbacks of this happy-go-lucky approach.
