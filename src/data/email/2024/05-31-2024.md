linkOneText: 'My hero Dr. Chuck created this comprehensive C programming course and shared it with the global freeCodeCamp community. Dr. Chuck is a University of Michigan computer science professor, and he is a hardcore advocate for everyone learning C. Not only will this course help you understand computer architecture and low-level programming. It will also teach you Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This course even includes an interview with the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum. As you may know, Python — like most modern programming languages — is built on top of C.

Tatev Aslanyan is a data scientist who has taught several freeCodeCamp courses over the past few years, mostly focused on Machine Learning. She'll teach you the key Linear Algebra concepts that come up over and over in developing modern AI tools. You'll learn about Vector Spaces, Euclidean Distance, Matrix Operations, Gaussian Elimination, and more.

linkThreeText: "On this week's podcast, I interview software engineer Jerod Santo, who hosts the longest-running podcast on open source, The Changelog. We talk about his life as a remote dev in Omaha, Nebraska, where he's raising his 6 kids. We also talk about the new Changelog News podcast with its weekly 10-minute updates on the world of open source. He shares his process for researching and surfacing interesting developments. And he also talks about emerging trends in open source, such as the controversial relicensing of Terraform. I had a blast learning from Jerod and I think you will, too.

linkFourText: "Andrew Brown is a CTO who has passed dozens of cloud certification exams over the years. And he's back with an updated guide to the popular AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. This course will not only teach you everything tested on the exam — it will also ground you in cloud engineering fundamentals. And no, that's not a typo. This really is a 50 hour course. But as opera singer Beverly Sills once said, there are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going.

linkFiveText: "Two of the most important tools in any data scientist's toolbox are Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. This tutorial by data scientist Olu Samuel Praise will teach you how to apply each of these techniques for analyzing data and making predictions. In short, Logistic Regression will give you a binary classification of data: is this picture of a hot dog — yes or no? And Linear Regression will give you a continuous value like a percentage. For example, predicting exam scores from students based on their attendance and hours studied. Again, both approaches are super useful and I think you'll learn a lot from this quick read.
