Dennis grew up in an immigrant family with 13 kids, and dropped out of school to work in construction. He taught himself to code while working as a janitor at a church. Then he started building websites for local plumbers. He eventually built a software system that he was able to sell to his employer, kicking off a career of entrepreneurship and freelance development. Dennis has tons of practical tips for building your network and finding clients. I had a blast hearing what he had to say. And I think you will, too.

You can use JS — the native language of the web — to build apps that can leverage that sweet desktop hardware. Imagine people alt-tabbing straight to your app instead of having to navigate to it through a browser. This course will teach you how to use Electron with React and TypeScript. And if you want to learn even more about Electron, I recently did a podcast interview with Jessica Lord, the creator of GitHub's Electron team. Tons of apps now use Electron, including Slack, Figma, and VS Code. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-desktop-apps-with-electron-react-and-typescript/"
