And with this GameDev course, you will learn how to use the Unreal Engine to build an 'endless runner' game — complete with obstacles, hit detection, and a core gameplay loop. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-an-endless-runner-game-using-unreal-engine-and-c/"
linkTwoText: "Binary Tree Algorithms come up all the time in developer job interviews. This course will help you understand common questions hiring managers may ask you about these data structures, and how to best answer them. You'll learn about Depth First, Breadth First, Max Root to Leaf Path Sum, and other core concepts.

linkThreeText: "When you visit a website like freeCodeCamp.org, your computer starts sending packets of data back and forth across the internet using the Internet Protocol. The IPv4 protocol came out way back in 1980, and gives every server its own 4-byte address. (That's 4 numbers between 0 and 255. For example, the localhost address: 127.0.0.1). But this only results in 4.3 billion possible combinations. And websites are already using almost all of these. Thankfully, the newer IPv6 protocol can save humanity from the threat of 'address exhaustion'. This article will show you how IPv6 works.
