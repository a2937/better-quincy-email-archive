He wanted to analyze his performance data, but found the event's official website to be lacking. In this tutorial, he'll show you how he scraped the data, cleaned it, and analyzed it himself using Python. He'll also show how he created data visualizations and even coded an app so his fellow racers can view their results. If you're looking for real-life hands-on data science projects, this is an excellent one to learn from and find inspiration in.
