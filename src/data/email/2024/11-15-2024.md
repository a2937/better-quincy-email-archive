He runs the open source HELM project, which benchmarks the capabilities of LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama against one another. We talk about the ragged frontier of LLM use cases, Open Weight models and how they're different from open source software, and his predictions for how AI will impact the job market. I had a blast and learned so much from this conversation. And I think you will, too.
