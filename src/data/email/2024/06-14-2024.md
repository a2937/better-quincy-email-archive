linkOneText: "freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive course to help you learn the Python skills used in data science. You'll start by learning the basics of data analytics, such as data wrangling, filtering, and statistical analysis. Then you'll apply those skills toward the field of A/B Testing, through a series of practical projects. This course is an excellent place to strengthen your Python abilities.

linkTwoText: "Learn High-level System Design with this new software architecture course. Keerti is a software engineer and teacher, and she'll introduce you to principles for building sophisticated apps. You can code along at home and build three API services that chunk data, transcode the data with FFmpeg, and stream it using Adaptive Bitrate Streaming.

linkThreeText: "On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview Dr. Chuck, creator of the popular Python for Everyone course. He's a Computer Science professor at University of Michigan, and he's taught coding to millions of students through his freeCodeCamp courses. We talk about what separates a “Master Programmer” from an average one. We delve into what he sees as the biggest shortcomings of university programs — even elite ones like the one he teaches at. We also discuss his theories on the recent tech layoffs, and his suggestions for how devs can stay ahead of recent breakthroughs in AI.

linkFourText: 'Learn how to build 3D graphics and games that run in a browser. ThreeJS is a powerful JavaScript library that abstracts away the complexities of WebGL. This course will walk you through building five projects, including a 3D model of the Earth, a wireframe wormhole, and a physics demo complete with realistic collisions. Happy rendering.

linkFiveText: "You may have heard people talk about an emerging technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This is when an AI looks up information from outside sources to improve its own responses. Well, freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will help you understand RAG so you can use it in your AI models. Even if you don't have time to read the whole thing, I still encourage you to bookmark it for future reference.
