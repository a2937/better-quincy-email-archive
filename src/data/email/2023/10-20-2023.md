linkFiveText: "If you're anything like me, your browser probably has way too many tabs open right now. Not only are these eating up your computer's memory — they are also opening you up to a type of malicious attack called “Tabnabbing”. This may just sound like something PacMan does, but it can lead to some serious consequences. This quick tutorial by Juanita Washington will explain how Tabnabbing techniques work, so that you can defend yourself against bad actors who would use Tabnabbing to trick you.

weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'Every time I think I'm doing some horrible front end code that ‘works’ I think back to when Fallout 3 wanted to animate a train, but objects can't move in their engine. So they gave an invisible guy a train-shaped-sized hat instead, and made him run the tracks. That's the spirit.'* — Front End Developer freezydorito on Twitter (And yes, that is really how Fallout 3's trains work)"
