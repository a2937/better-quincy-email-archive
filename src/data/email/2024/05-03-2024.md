Ben is a prolific coding tutorial creator, and has a weird but popular TikTok channel as well. I had a blast learning more about his adventures over the past few years. Did you know he sleeps 9 hours every single night? He swears by it.

The burgeoning field of “AI Engineering” is essentially just web developers using AI APIs and off-the-shelf tools to power up their existing apps. We just published this course, taught by frequent freeCodeCamp contributor Tom Chant. It will introduce you to this new skill set and this new way of leveraging AI.

weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'Game development is very difficult. Nobody sets out to create a game that's not fun. It's all of the challenges and difficulties that happen throughout development that determine whether a game is a failure or a success. I think playing those thousands of games is the single best and easiest way to learn from my predecessors.'* — Masahiro Sakurai, Software Engineer, Game Developer, and Creator of Kirby"
