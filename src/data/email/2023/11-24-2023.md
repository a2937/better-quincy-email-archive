You'll learn how to use the powerful scikit-learn library to implement Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient-Boosting Machines, and other building blocks of AI. This is a serious course, with all the rigor you've come to expect from the freeCodeCamp engineering community. I don't blame anyone for wanting to just chill this Thanksgiving weekend. But if you want to build some hard skills, freeCodeCamp's gobble gobble got you. (18 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-with-python-and-scikit-learn/"
