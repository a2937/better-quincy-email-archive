She painstakingly recreates manufactured objects like cameras, gameboys, and synthesizers using nothing but CSS. We talk about her childhood in Mexico and Texas, dropping out of architecture school, her listless years of working in retail, and how she ultimately learned to code using freeCodeCamp and got her first developer role.
