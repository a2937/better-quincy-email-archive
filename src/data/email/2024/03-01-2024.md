linkOneText: "Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that creates new content based on its training data, rather than just returning a pre-programmed response. You may have tried creating text or images using models like GPT-4, Gemini, or the open source Llama 2. But how do these models actually work? This in-depth freeCodeCamp course will teach you the underlying Machine Learning concepts that you can use to create your own models. And it'll show you how to leverage popular tools like Langchain, Vector Databases, Hugging Face, and more. (30 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-generative-ai-in/"

This course — taught by CTO and prolific freeCodeCamp contributor Andrew Brown — will help prepare you for the exam. You'll learn about classical AI models, Machine Learning pipelines, Azure Cognitive Services, and more.

linkFourText: "freeCodeCamp just published another full-length handbook — this time on Regular Expressions. RegEx are one of the most powerful — and most confusing — features of modern programming languages. You can use RegEx to search through data, validate user input, and even find complex patterns within text. This handbook will teach you key concepts like anchors, grouping, metacharacters, and lookahead. And you'll learn a lot of advanced JavaScript RegEx techniques, too.

linkFiveText: "Serverless Architecture is a popular approach toward building apps in 2024. Despite the name, there are still servers in a data center somewhere. This isn't magic. But the tools abstract the servers away for you. In this intermediate JavaScript course, Software Engineer Justin Mitchel will teach you how to take a simple Node.js app and run it on AWS Lambda with a serverless Postgres database. He'll even show you how to automate deployment using GitHub Actions and Vercel. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/serverless-node-js-tutorial/"
