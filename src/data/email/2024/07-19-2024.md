Interestingly, she studied photography in school and never even took a programming class. We talk about how as a kid she and her sister ran a dial-in BBS back before there were websites. We also talk about how she stayed at her first developer job for 7 years, and how she spent the first year of it “in abject fear of losing my job.” (2 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/from-doing-data-entry-to-becoming-a-developer-with-jessica-chan-aka-coder-coder-podcast-132/"
