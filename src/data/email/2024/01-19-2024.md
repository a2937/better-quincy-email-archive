linkOneText: "Many people who are learning to code have the goal of eventually working as a developer. But landing that first developer role is not an easy task. Luckily, my friend Lane Wagner created this course to help guide you through the process. It's jam-packed with tips from me and a lot of other developers.

linkTwoText: "For years, people have asked for an in-depth course on Data Engineering. And I'm thrilled to say freeCodeCamp just published one, and it's a banger. Data Engineers design systems to collect, store, and analyze data — systems that Data Scientists and Data Analysts rely on. This course will teach you key concepts like Data Pipelines and ETL (Extract-Transform-Load). And you'll learn how to use tools like Docker, CRON, and Apache Airflow.

linkThreeText: 'freeCodeCamp also just published a full-length book on Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It will teach you Java Design Patterns, File Handling, I/O, Concurrent Data Structures, and more. And freeCodeCamp published a more beginner-friendly Java OOP book by the same author a while back, too. (full-length book): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-in-java/'
linkFourText: "freeCodeCamp uses the open source NGINX web server, and more than one third of all other websites do, too. NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture so you can handle a ton of concurrent users with fewer servers. We just published a crash course on using NGINX for back-end development. You'll learn how to use it for load balancing, reverse proxying, data streaming, and even as a Microservice Architecture. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nginx/"
linkFiveText: 'You may have heard the term “ACID database”. It refers to a database that guarantees transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. MySQL and PostgreSQL are fully ACID-compliant. Other databases like MongoDB and Cassandra have partial ACID guarantees. So what are these properties and why are they so important? This article by Daniel Adetunji will explain everything using helpful analogies and some of his own artwork. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/acid-databases-explained/'
