You can be the first of your friends to understand and appreciate how Quantum Computing works. The first half of this course focuses on the math behind quantum computing algorithms. You'll learn about Complex Numbers and Linear Algebra. Then you'll learn concepts like Qubits — Quantum Bits — along with Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Circuits, and Phase Kickback. Even though this course is designed for newcomers to Quantum Computing, I'm not going to downplay the importance of math skills in understanding this course. Fortunately, if you want to improve your math skills, freeCodeCamp also has a ton of university-level math courses to help get you there.

I ask him tons of questions about what it takes to become a professional designer in 2024. And we learn all about his own coding journey. He got his start creating thousands of logos for design clients. And he shares the story of how he got complacent mid-career — right before most of his client work evaporated overnight. He hasn't taken his eye off the ball ever since. It was a blast learning so much from Gary. I think you'll enjoy this, too.
