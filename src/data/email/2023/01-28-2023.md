If you have forgotten much of the Algebra you learned — or if you never really learned it well in the first place — this course is for you. In it, freeCodeCamp instructor Ed Pratowski will teach you how to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to do math. You'll learn all about Variables, Graphing, Cartesian Planes, Factoring, and more.
