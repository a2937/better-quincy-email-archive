linkFiveText: "On this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview 100Devs founder Leon Noel. Growing up, Leon felt he needed to become a doctor in order to be considered successful. But his interest in coding inspired him to drop out of Yale and build software tools for scientists. He went through a startup accelerator, taught coding in his community, and ultimately built a Discord server with 60,000 people learning to code together. We talk about the science behind learning, and what approaches have helped his students the most. We even talk about Jazz pianist Thelonious Monk, and Leon's love of the animated X-Men show.
