linkOneText: "Bun is hot out of the oven. The Node.js alternative JavaScript Runtime just released their version 1.0 last month, and already freeCodeCamp has this crash course for you. You'll learn how to set up a Bun web server, create routes, handle errors, add plugins, and wire everything to your front end. A lot of devs seem to dig Bun's superior performance and its built-in support for TypeScript and JSX. If you already know some Node.js, Bun shouldn't be too time-consuming to learn. This crash course is a good place to jump in. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-bun-a-faster-node-js-alternative"
linkTwoText: "If you're building an AI system, please consider learning about AI ethics. freeCodeCamp just published our second primer on this important and potentially extinction-preventing topic. You don't need to know a lot about programming or about philosophy to enjoy this course. You'll learn about the current Black Box AI approach that many Large Language Models use, and its limitations. You'll also learn about some scenarios that were previously considered to be science fiction, such as The Singularity. freeCodeCamp is proud to help inform the discourse on developing AI tools responsibly.

linkThreeText: "If you've experimented with Large Language Models like GPT-4, you may be somewhat disappointed by their capabilities. Well, getting good responses out of LLMs is a skill in itself. This course will teach you the art and the science of Prompt Engineering, and even introduce some AI-assisted coding concepts. Then you'll be able to write clearer prompts and get more helpful responses from AI. I spent some time learning these techniques myself, and was blown away by how much more useful they made ChatGPT for me.

linkFourText: "You may have used Notion before to organize your thoughts or plan a project. What if I told you that you could code your own Notion clone using open source tools? This course will walk you through doing just that. You'll learn to use the popular Next.js web development framework, the DALL-E AI image creator, Tailwind CSS, and even some Object Relational Mappers to communicate with your databases. You'll code the User Interface, code the back end, then deploy your finished app to the cloud.

linkFiveText: "Put on your learning cap, because we're going to learn the many ways that computers talk to one another. This tutorial will whisk you through 6 key API integration patterns: REST APIs, Remote Procedure Calls, GraphQL, Polling, WebSockets, and WebHooks. By the end of this quick tutorial, you'll have a much better understanding of how the internet really works. This will make you a more well-rounded developer.
