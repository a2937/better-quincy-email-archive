He made up for this by being extremely good at predictive analytics — honing his instincts for what type of pitch is coming across home plate. I learned this during my insight-filled conversation with Ken Jee. He's a golfer turned data scientist who works closely with professional athletes. During my podcast interview, Ken shares a ton of tips for folks interested in getting into data science and machine learning, and for athletes who want to gain a quantitative edge on their competitors.

weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'I often compare open source to science. Science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas — making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do.'* — Linus Torvalds, programmer, creator of Linux, and open source advocate"
