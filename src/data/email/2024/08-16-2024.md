This crash course will teach you key concepts, and how to use an open dataset from Kaggle to code your first model.

linkThreeText: "This week on the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Angie Jones, a test engineer and inventor who holds 27 software patents. She's worked at companies like IBM and Twitter, doing both test engineering and developer advocacy. We talk about how a bad performance review from a boss early in her career taught her to be less timid and more vocal about her ideas. We also talk about her love of virtual worlds like Second Life, and how she uses AI to debug code.

linkFourText: "Developers often build small chunks of reusable code called Components. And at some point it makes sense to pull these together into a full-blown Component Library. This tutorial will give you a solid understanding of what Component Libraries are, their history, and how they differ from Design Systems. You'll learn how to wield the power of Component Libraries for yourself, so you can avoid rewriting code that other devs have written so many times before, and instead focus on the novel work to be done.
