This course from Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor, who teaches computer science in Finland, will show you how to design such a system. You'll code an AI that can recognize and classify drawings. If you draw a fish, your AI will learn to recognize it as a fish. This is an excellent Machine Learning fundamentals course for any dev with some JavaScript knowledge and a bit of curiosity.

linkFiveText: '20 years ago, a few developers sat down to catalog the most common security issues they were discovering on the web. And from that, the OWASP Top 10 emerged as a popular reference for devs. You can use OWASP as a checklist to ensure a baseline level of security in your apps. This course will teach you how to spot these common pitfalls and avoid them in your projects.
