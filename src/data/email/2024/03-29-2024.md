In this intermediate course, you'll code your own back end for a Spotify-like app. You'll learn how to deploy a Node.js API to the web. And you'll build out all the necessary database and authentication features along the way. (Note that Nest.js is similar to Next.js, but Nest.js uses TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Angular. freeCodeCamp also has comprehensive Next.js courses if you want to learn that as well.)

This said, these tools do make it dramatically easier for both developers and non-developers to get things done. This new course is taught by one of freeCodeCamp's most popular instructors, Ania Kubów. She'll teach you how to automate boring tasks by leveraging AI tools and creating efficient automation pipelines.

I speak Chinese and a little Japanese, and I can tell you that the Chinese characters in the word “Kanban” translate to “look board” — something you can look at to quickly understand what's going on with a project. You may have used popular Kanban tools like Trello. But have you ever coded your own Kanban? Well, today's the day. This project-oriented tutorial will teach you how to use React, Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and other modern webdev tools.

She's worked as a software engineer for more than a decade at companies like GitHub and Glitch. Among her many accomplishments, she created the Electron team at GitHub. Electron is a library for building desktop apps using browser technologies. If you've used the desktop version of Slack, Figma, or VS Code, you've used Electron. We had such a fun time talking about her journey from architecture student to city hall to working at the highest levels of tech.
