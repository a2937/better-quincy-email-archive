SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and it's one of the most efficient ways to store images for icons or other simple patterns. It's so efficient because it stores the literal coordinates of all the lines and colors of your image. In this tutorial, freeCodeCamp contributor Hunor Márton Borbély will teach you how to work with SVG files by coding your own Christmas tree, gingerbread man, and snowflake art.

linkFiveText: "Developers sometimes encode data as raw text using Base64, even though it takes up 33% more storage than binary. Why do they do this? Well, Base64 is just a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and two symbols: + and /. Just to check my math, that's 26 + 26 + 10 + 2 = 64 characters, right? This tutorial will teach you all the things you never knew you wanted to know about Base64. And it will solve the mystery of why developers continue to use this even today.
