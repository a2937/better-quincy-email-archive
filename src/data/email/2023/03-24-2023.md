weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'I think that in life, as in game design, you have to find the fun. There is joy out there waiting to be discovered, but it might not be where you expected.

You can’t decide what something’s going to be before you embark on it, and you shouldn’t stick with a bad idea just because you’re fond of it. Take action as quickly and repeatedly as possible. Take advantage of what you already know. And take liberties with tradition.

But most importantly, take the time to appreciate the possibilities, and make sure all of your decisions are interesting ones.'* — Sid Meier, game developer and creator of the Civilization game series"
