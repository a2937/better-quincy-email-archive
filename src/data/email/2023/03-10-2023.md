You'll learn these tools and concepts from Michelle Krummel. She has more than 20 years of teaching experience. You'll learn about mathematical notation, TexMaker, Overleaf, and the many packages available in the LaTeX ecosystem.

In this tutorial, Deborah Kurata will teach you how to create a local Git repository with a main branch, then branch off of it. She'll show you how to commit your code changes, then merge those files back into the main branch. This is what I like to call the 'core gameplay loop' of software development. Enjoy.

The find command is one of those powerful tools. This tutorial will show you how to search through file systems by owner, type, permissions, recency, and even regex search. This is some SysAdmin-level stuff. And we'll keep these Linux tutorials coming. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-search-files-effectively-in-linux/"
