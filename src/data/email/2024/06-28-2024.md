He's since published YouTube courses that millions of people have watched. We talk about how he learned to code by volunteering to take on web design projects at work. He started making design tutorials on YouTube and published 300 in a single year. And he accomplished all this from Perth, Australia — as far as you can get from Silicon Valley. I think you'll dig our conversation.

weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'Whether it's a 2D game or a 3D game, I always try to create a believable world for that game. Even the text of a game can contribute to that world feeling alive, I think. Having text prepared for every place you investigate, and having that text change depending on the circumstances, I think really helps create the illusion that you are “in” that world.'* — Hideo Kojima, Creator of Metal Gear Solid"
