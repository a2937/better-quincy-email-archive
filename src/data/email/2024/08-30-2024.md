At the time, the doctors told her she'd never be able to live independently again. But she learned how to walk again and talk again. And eventually she learned a ton about Systems Administration and Cloud Engineering. Today, more than 500,000 students have learned these developer concepts from her. We talk about Hiroko's entire life — from learning English as an immigrant from Japan, to getting her first job in tech, to becoming a prolific teacher.
