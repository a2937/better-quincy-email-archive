Since then, we've built an interactive 3,000-hour core curriculum that teaches math, programming, and computer science. We've also built a library of more than 12,000 programming tutorials and more than 1,000 full-length YouTube courses. And most importantly, we've brought together a supportive community of developers who are eager to help people expand their skills. In this brief article and update video, you'll learn about the path ahead, along with some major improvements we're making to freeCodeCamp's core curriculum.

Unlike the more technical certifications that freeCodeCamp also has prep courses for, this credential focuses on the business aspects of cloud computing and foundational cloud concepts. It may be a good fit for you as a professional. And if so, this course is an excellent place to start.

linkThreeText: "This week's freeCodeCamp podcast is one of the best interviews I've ever done. Dorian had a rough upbringing in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. As a kid, he dropped out of high school and got arrested 4 times for crimes like stealing cars. His mother had to get him out of there, and his parole officer agreed to let him move to Las Vegas. There he found stable jobs parking cars at casinos. He taught himself how to code using freeCodeCamp, and eventually got software engineering jobs at Fortune 500 companies. I hope you enjoy this whirlwind of an interview.

This quick tutorial will teach you some search operators you can use for extremely deep searching, so you can find secrets that are right out in the open waiting to be discovered.
