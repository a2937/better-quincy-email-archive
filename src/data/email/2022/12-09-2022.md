linkOneText: "This freeCodeCamp course will teach you how to code your own Python apps that run directly on Windows, Mac, or Linux — not just in a browser. You'll learn powerful Python libraries like Qt and PySide6. This way you can build apps that run natively on computers, and leverage their full processing power. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-gui-development-using-pyside6-and-qt/"
linkTwoText: "Swift is a powerful programming language developed by Apple. A lot of developers who build apps for either iOS and MacOS prefer to code in Swift. In this in-depth course, a lead iOS developer will teach you Swift development fundamentals. You'll learn about variables, operators, error handling, and even asynchronous programming.

linkThreeText: "If you're preparing for a coding interview as part of your developer job search, you're going to want to read this. Dijkstra's Algorithm is an iconic graph algorithm with many uses in computer science. You can use it to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, or the shortest path from one fixed node to the rest of the nodes in a graph. This detailed explanation — with diagrams and a pseudocode example — will help you appreciate its true brilliance.

weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'A most important, but also most elusive, aspect of any tool is its influence on the habits of those who train themselves in its use. If the tool is a programming language, this influence is — whether we like it or not — an influence on our thinking habits.'* — Edsger Dijkstra, Mathematician and Computer Scientist"
