linkFiveText: 'This week on the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Beau Carnes, who oversees the freeCodeCamp community YouTube channel. Over the past 5 years, Beau has taught dozens of coding tutorials and helped curate more than 1,000 courses. We talk about his transition from high school special education teacher to software engineer. He shares the story of how he earned his second degree in just 6 months while raising 3 kids and running a stilt-walking service. This is my first video podcast, so you can actually watch me and Beau talk while you listen. Or you can just listen the old-fashioned way in your browser or podcast app of choice.
