linkOneText: "freeCodeCamp just published a massive TypeScript course to help you learn the art of statically-typed JavaScript. Most scripting languages like JavaScript and Python are dynamically-typed. But this causes so many additional coding errors. By sticking with static types — like Java and C++ do — JavaScript developers can save so much headache. This beginner course is taught by legendary coding instructor John Smilga. I love his no-nonsense teaching style and the way he makes even advanced concepts easier to understand. And you can apply what you're learning by coding along at home and building your own ecommerce platform project in TypeScript.

Phoebe worked from age 12 at her parent's Chinese take-out restaurant. After college, the high cost of childcare forced her to leave her career so she could raise her two kids. After two years of teaching herself to code using freeCodeCamp, she got her first job as a developer.

linkThreeText: "How can two people communicate securely through an insecure channel? That is a fundamental challenge in cryptography. One approach is by using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm. freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will teach you how to leverage Diffie-Hellman to protect your data in transit, as it moves from between clients and servers. This handbook dives deep into the math that makes this possible, and uses tons of diagrams to explain the theory. It also explores older solutions, such as Hash-based Message Authentication Code. And you'll immediately put all this new knowledge to use by building a secure messaging project. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hmac-diffie-hellman-in-node/"

You'll start off this course by learning some C# and .NET fundamentals while coding a menu app. Then you'll dive into some advanced features while building your own clone of Google Docs. Finally, you'll bring everything together by building a payment app. Along the way, you'll get familiar with Microsoft's powerful Visual Studio coding environment.
