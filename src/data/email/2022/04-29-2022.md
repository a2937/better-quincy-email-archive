You'll get a solid introduction to ARM emulation and program structure. You'll also learn how to use registers, stacks, logical operators, branches, subroutines, and memory addressing modes.

linkThreeText: "Last week I shared a tutorial that explained how Linux and MacOS file permissions work. This week we're going deeper down the rabbit hole to teach you about CHOWN and CHMOD. No, these are not types of foreign cuisine. They are helpful tools you can use right in your command line to control who can access or modify a file.

linkFourText: "You may have heard of the Fibonacci Sequence in math class. It's a series of numbers used in the Golden Ratio — most famously by Leonardo Divinci when painting the Mona Lisa. This tutorial will explain how the Fibonacci Sequence works, and how you can write a Python program that will print any number of digits from the sequence.

linkFiveText: 'Memoization is a common technique to speed up your applications. Instead of re-running calculations over and over again, you can store the results in cache. Then your code can retrieve that value the next time it needs it. This tutorial will show you some practical JavaScript memoization examples to help you grok this concept.

weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code.'* — Eric S. Raymond, author of the pioneering open source essay, “The Cathedral and the Bazaar”"
