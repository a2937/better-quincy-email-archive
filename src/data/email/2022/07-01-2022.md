linkOneText: "Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the “locally optimal” solution at each stage of problem solving — regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward — never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum — the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide & Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-greedy-algorithms/"

This saves you the hassle of manually configuring them each time you want to deploy. This course will teach you how to use Terraform and Azure to build your own development environment. You'll learn about subnets, security groups, and The Provisioner — and no, that is not a WWE villain.
