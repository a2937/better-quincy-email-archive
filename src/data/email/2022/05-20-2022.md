weekContent: "Quote of the Week: *'The Oberheim DMX [drum machine], released in 1981, featured separate voice boards for each sound, where the tuning would alter sample playback rate. Over the years, many people attributed a particular kind of ‘groove’ to the DMX. After much investigation, I discovered that this is just a by-product of the original factory bass drum sound containing a small amount of silence at the very start of the sample. This delay imparts a very ‘lazy’, dragging feel on any beat using the bass drum — and the lower the pitch the greater the drag.'* — A fun fact from the music production-focused Attack Magazine"
